# Context theoretical foundation

## Context

As natural as context sounds it’s been proven to be quite difficult to clarify its concept (Dey, 1999). Several definitions from multi-disciplinary areas can be found and as expected, presenting an opinion of its definition minding to its domain (Bradley, 2005).

The Cambridge Dictionary defines context as “the text or speech that comes immediately before and after a particular phrase or piece of text and helps to explain it’s meaning”. In Linguistics (Fetzer, 1997) defined context as a “tripartite system of objective, social and subjective worlds, their sub-systems and presuppositions”. In Psychology (Smith, 1988) defined context as “a concept that denotes a great variety of intrinsic or extrinsic characteristics of the presentation or test of an item”.

With the modern thriving of mobile technology, context has been in focus in pervasive computing more than ever, such area addresses context as conditions from surroundings that’ll adapt applications to infer user’s situations and needs. In this area definitions from context found in the literature may diverge in focusing either in the application or the user (Bradley, 2005), Moran and Dourish (2001) defined context as the “physical and social situation in which computational devices are embedded.”, in contrast Dey, Abowd and Wood (1999) defined context as “the user’s physical, social, emotional or informational state”. Regardless, Dey’s definition for what is context in terms of an application is the most referred definition and what has been considered, presenting it as “Context is any information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity. An entity is a person, place, or object that is considered relevant to the interaction between a user and an application, including the user and applications themselves”.

## Categories of context

As decentralized as it seems what context truly is, categorizing it presents to be even remote from a consensus. Perera et al. (2014) presented an extensive comparison between them, including their relationship, advantages and disadvantages. They recognize two classifications of context categories: operational and conceptual. The operational one normally focusses on the problems involving the acquisition of the data while the conceptual one helps to understand the relationships between different contexts. Both classifications lack the capacity to contain all the necessary knowledge for context-awareness applications.
